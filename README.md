# Codesmith-Hackathon-1
We will be creating a chrome extension that can save URL links, and highlight parts of a webpage.

Create an object or file that keeps track of all of the websites that we want to save
maybe we could do this in a JSON file
some object could hold values for the highlighted parts and the website itself(we'd implement this later if we have time)
